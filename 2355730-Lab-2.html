            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>My latest project is a web-based task management application that allows users to organize their daily activities, set reminders, and track their progress. It uses JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to create a smooth and responsive user interface. This project taught me a lot about front-end development and improving user experience through interactivity.</p>
